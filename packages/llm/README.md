# llm/ — LLM capability family

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The llm group provides the harness's model-call capability: one provider-neutral service through which any composition streams requests to a model provider, plus an adapter, retry execution, and measurement. The core `llm` package defines the message, content-block, and stream-chunk vocabulary every plugin and the session log use; the provider adapter translates a provider's wire format into that vocabulary; `llm-retry` re-runs failed requests at durable agent-step boundaries; and `token-meter` measures request and context pressure from the durable log. This page maps the group; each package README owns its per-package contract.

## Packages

| Package | Role | ctx key |
|---|---|---|
| [`llm/`](llm/README.md) | Streams one model call through a registered provider adapter and shares the harness message, block, and chunk vocabulary | `ctx.llm` |
| [`llm-pi-ai/`](llm-pi-ai/README.md) | Serves the `krokki-official` route and other configured provider routes through pi-ai catalogs and wire protocols, including hand-declared gateways | registers on `ctx.llm` |
| [`llm-retry/`](llm-retry/README.md) | Retries failed model requests under each provider's policy at durable agent-step boundaries | listens to `agent/request-error` |
| [`token-meter/`](token-meter/README.md) | Measures request and context pressure from the durable session log with a fixed heuristic | `ctx.tokenMeter` |
